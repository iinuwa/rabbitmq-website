# Daily use with Khepri

Even though the metadata store doesnâ€™t store messages, its behavior will
affect day-to-day use of RabbitMQ because clients will want to authenticate
and declare resources.

The reason is the same than the one explained in the [clustering
caveats](./clustering#caveats): a quorum number of cluster members must be
available for the metadata store to accept updates.

## Declaring resources

The topology that defines how messages are routed is stored in the metadata store. The way to declare a resource remains the same regardless of the active metadata store backend.

However, where it was possible to declare a queue with Mnesia even if the
majority of the cluster was either down or unreachable, the same operation
with Khepri will timeout. This way the client can react appropriately to the
issue, instead of hoping for the best with the various network partition
recovery strategies that are implemented on top of Mnesia.

Here is an example of the PerfTest tool trying to declare the exchange and
queue it needs in a cluster where only 1 out of 5 nodes is running:

```
$ PerfTest

id: test-161339-979, starting consumer #0
id: test-161339-979, starting consumer #0, channel #0
Main thread caught exception: java.io.IOException
16:14:10.638 [com.rabbitmq.perf.PerfTest.main()] ERROR com.rabbitmq.perf.PerfTest - Main thread caught exception
(...)
```

At the same time, the RabbitMQ node logged the following messages:
```
[error] <0.1373.0> Error on AMQP connection <0.1373.0> (127.0.0.1:55165 -> 127.0.0.1:5672 - perf-test-consumer-0, vhost: '/', user: 'guest', state: running), channel 1:
[error] <0.1373.0>  operation exchange.declare caused a connection exception internal_error: "failed to declare exchange 'direct' in vhost '/' because the operation timed out"
```
